# Lab 13

## Description
This project is a simple text-based game implemented in Java. It allows players to control a character and engage in battles with a bot. Players can choose their weapons and armor, and then take turns attacking or defending against the bot.

## Features
- Player can choose between a sword or a bow as their weapon.
- Player can choose between light or heavy armor for protection.
- Bot also selects its weapon and armor randomly.
- Players and bots take turns attacking or defending.
- Game continues until the player decides to exit.

## What I Learned
- Implemented a text-based game using object-oriented programming principles in Java.
- Utilized inheritance to create subclasses for different types of weapons and armor.
- Learned how to use polymorphism by overriding methods in subclasses to provide specialized functionality.
- Practiced handling user input and validation using the Scanner class.
- Gained experience in managing game logic within a loop, including turn-based gameplay and condition checking.
- Enhanced my understanding of modular programming by organizing code into separate packages and classes.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Compile the Main.java file using the Java compiler.
4. Run the compiled Main.class file to start the game.

## Usage
- Upon starting the game, follow the prompts to choose your weapon and armor.
- Enter commands to attack, defend, or exit the game.
